For reasons I do not understand, you cannot say ./makecrosstalk; bash
cannot find the executable file, even though it is present and
is executable. You likewise cannot say /usr/local/bin/crosssrc/makecrosstalk;
bash cannot find the source file. ?????

you must say

. makecrosstalk

or

source makecrosstalk
