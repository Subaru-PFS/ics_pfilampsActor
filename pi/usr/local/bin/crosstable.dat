# This file contains expected lamp fluxes and ratios
# The first four lines are the matrix which maps lamp
# brightness in ADC units into ADC output in the four channels.
# Thus a column in this matrix are ratios of the ouput
# in each channel to the output in the index channel. If b
# is the ADC vector and x is the vector whose only nonzero elemen
# is the lamp brightness for that channel, and A is the matrix,
#   b = Ax.
# the routine crosstalk solves for x.
#
# the last row are the expected lamp brightnesses, and crosstalk
# also normalizes its brightnesses to these values.
